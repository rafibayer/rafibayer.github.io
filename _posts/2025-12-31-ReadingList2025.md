Yippee! Another year of reading, and I even made a real blog post since my last reading list. Check out [ants-again]({% post_url 2025-12-13-Ants %}) (unless you're scared of bugs.)

Like last year, a **\*** indicates I especially enjoyed a book. I'm trying to be a bit more conservative with the **\*** instead of just giving it to every other book, but it's so hard :)
