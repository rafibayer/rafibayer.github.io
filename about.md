Hi, I'm Rafi. I am a Senior Software Engineer with \[redacted\], working on the platform networking team in the \[redacted\] product group. Previously I worked on the Microsoft Azure Networking team, primarily on the performance and scalability of the networking control plane. I graduated with a degree in Informatics from the University of Washington (go dawgs).

This site is my personal blog, I mostly cover side projects or write about topics I find interesting.
